    "A colleague has been asked to write a program to calculate a root of a continuous function using the **bisection method** as described in the following brief:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "The bisection method is a simple numerical technique to find a root of a continuous function in an interval where this function changes sign. According to [Intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem), the continuous function $f=f(x)$ has at least one root in the interval $[a, b]$, if $f(a)f(b) \\leq 0$. Utilising this fact, the following 3-step algorithm will find the root of such function within a desired accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the midpoint $c = (a+b)/2$ and evaluate the function at this point $f(c)$.\n",
    "2. If $ (b-a)/2 < \\epsilon_1 $ or $|f(c)| < \\epsilon_2 $, then return $c$ as the root and stop. \n",
    "3. Otherwise, depending on the sign of $f(c)$ replace either $a$ or $b$ with $c$, such that $f(a)f(b) < 0$ for the new $a$ and $b$. Then go to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The criteria introduced in step 2 ensures the difference between the answer and the real root to be less than $\\epsilon_1$ or _that_ the function value at the answer is smaller than $\\epsilon_2$ (so it can be considered an approximate root). You are supposed to write a function that takes $a$, $b$, $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$ as inputs and returns a root using the bisection method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the bisection method does not guarantee or detect a change of sign in an interval if the two end points have similar signs. Hence, your program should first search for some subinterval where the function changes sign. This can be achieved by halving the intervals consecutively until in one of the smaller subinterval the function changes sign. If no such an interval is found while the size of the smallest interval is still bigger than $\\epsilon_1$, the function returns 'None' and prints out \"failed to find a root\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Test your code for a continuous function on a given interval.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It does not work properly. There are some problems in this function. \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) When I run root_finder(2,3,.0001,0.00001), it returns that 'the root is 2.25'. However there is no root in interval [2,3]. So, we need to change it as returning \"None\" and print \"fail to find a root\".  We could change it as adding some code in the first while loop. In that while loop, there is a 'for loop' and in 'for loop' there is an 'if statement'. In 'if statement', we assign new values a and b, but we do not check that f(a) * f(b) is positive or negative. So, we need the code to check it. I added\n",
    "\n",
    "         if ff(a) * ff(b) < 0:      \n",
    "             findinterval = 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "under where we assign new variables a and b to check that  ff(a) and ff(b) have different signs. If they have different signs, we assign findinterval is 0. If not, running while loop again and at the end we get None and print \"fail to find a root\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) When I run root_finder(0,3,.0001,0.00001), the error between real root and return value is quite big. For example, we can get a root as 1 in interval [0,3], but when I run the code it says that the root is 1.5. There exists a quite big error. So, we need to change it in order to get reasonable root. We could change it as adding abs() in 'if statement' in the second 'while loop'. Actually, we have if (ff(c)<eps2):, but we have to change it as if (abs(ff(c))<eps2): to get accurate root. In the brief instruction above the root_finder function, it says that $|f(c)| < \\epsilon_2 $. So, we have to change it in order to get accurate root. For example, when I run root_finder(0,3,.0001,0.00001), we get 1.5. On the other hand, when I run root_finder_modified(0,3,.0001,0.00001), we get 1.000030517578125.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Interval which starts with one of the roots or ends with one of the roots or both.\n",
    "\n",
    " When I run root_finder(1,4, eps1, eps2), it returns only 4. However in real world, we could easily find that x^2-5x+4 = 0 has two roots as 1 and 4. So, I want to get 2 roots in this function. I could change the code to get two roots. In 'if statement' related to (findinterval == 1), we could add some conditions to get two roots. When both abs(ff(a)) and abs(ff(b)) are smaller than eps2, it means that a and b are roots. If one of them is smaller than eps2, it is a root and we have to find if there is another root in this interval. To check this, I recall the function again. For example, when I run root_finder_modified(0,4, eps1, eps2) there are two roots 1 and 4 in this interval. So making code for returning 4 if abs(ff(4)) < eps2 and find another root as x = root_finder_modified(0,(0+4)/2,eps1, eps2). At the end of this conditional statement, it should return x and b.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) In the first 'while loop', we have to change 'for j in range(n): ' to 'for j in range(2):'. The reason is that when we run root_finder(0,10, eps1, eps2), it has an error like \"out of range\". Above this line, we assign n as n * 2. So we have to change n to 2."

Imagine a road that is divided into a number of cells which can contain only one car. For now, let's assume this road is one-way from left to right. We also discretise time into steps. At each step a car moves to its adjacent right cell if it is empty; otherwise, it stays where it is (see the figure below). \n",

The new value `R[i,t+1]` depends on its old value at time $t$ (i.e. `R[i,t]`), and also on the old values of the neighbours (`R[i-1,t]` and `R[i+1,t]`). You might think about how you would fill out the tables below (on paper - no need to edit the table in your file) to use them to get an explicit form of the update rules (note we use notation here that `R[i,t]` is the same as $R^t(i)$ below):\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Storing `R[i,t]` at each time step is unnecessarily memory-consuming. Moreover, it is hard to track individual cars through the zeros and ones of `R[i,t]`. Instead, it is more efficient for many purposes to store the trajectories of each car in an array, `Traj[car,t]`, where each row records the trajectory for a different car, with the value in each successive column recording the location at each successive time step. Our next purpose is to use this array to calculate the average velocities of each car. So it is now better not to use the periodic boundary condition immediately, but to store the value of $N+1$ for the car that moves off the last cell (similarly storing the value of $N+2$ instead of 2 etc). For instance, for the 9-cell road shown in the previous figure `Traj` is constructed as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 & 3\\\\\n",
    "4 & 4 & 4 & 5\\\\\n",
    "5 & 5 & 6 & 7\\\\\n",
    "6 & 7 & 8 & 9\\\\\n",
    "9 & 9 & 10& 11\\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive `Traj[:,t+1]` from `Traj[:,t]`, we only need the current column of `R` and not the entire matrix `R[0:N,0:t+1]`. Hence, we are going to only keep the vector `r[0:N]`, which is the current state of the road with empty cells represented by 0 and cells with a car by 1 (i.e. `r=R[:,t]`). Now write a new funtion **`new_position(r,Traj)`** that takes the vector `r` and the current position vector `Traj[:,t]`, and returns the next column `Traj[:,t+1]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using `Traj[:,t+1]` and [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic) you can update `r` more easily. To update `r` from the state at `t` to `t+1` you will need to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- start a new array for `r` at `t+1` by filling `r[:]` values as zeros initially\n",
    "- take each element of `Traj[:,t+1]`\n",
    "- find the remainder when you divide that element by $N$, call it `j`\n",
    "- set `r[j-1]=1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note what is happening here - you are storing the cars in cells 1 up to N in array positions indexed 0 up to N-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write another function **`new_updateR(Traj[:,t+1])`** that takes the trajectory at `t+1` and returns a new vector `r` without using any `if` statements using this procedure outlined above. (Note here the size of `r` is $N$ and the size of `Traj` is $M \\times T$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of car `i` at time `t` can be readily calculated as **`Traj[i,t]-Traj[i,t-1]`**, which is either 0 or 1 cell per step. Write the function **`ave_vel(Traj,t)`** that takes the array of trajectories and the time step and returns the average velocity of all cars at time `t`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the functions you have written; **`new_position()`**, **`new_updateR()`** and **`ave_vel()`**, complete the following list of tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Test your function **`new_position()`** by using the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Put $M = 15$ cars in the first fifteen cells of a road that has $N = 50$ cells. Plot the average speed of all cars as a function of time up to $T=50$. How long does it take to reach a steady average speed?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Repeat question 2) for $M = 25$ and $M = 35$ and discuss the results. Is the final average speed the same for all $M$? Which is the largest value of $M$ for which you can reach the maximum average speed?"

Use `scipy.stats.bernoulli.rvs(p, size=N) ` to fill each cell in the inital configuration (see workshop 5 if you are not familiar with this function). This means the chance of having a car in a cell is `p`.  Therefore, if `N` is large enough, you expect to have `N*p` cars on the road. Set $N=800$, vary `p` from $0.2$ to $0.8$, and plot the average speed of cars at `T=200` as a function of `p`. Comment on the results. How does the number of cars affect their final average speed?\n",
